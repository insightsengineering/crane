# crane

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The {crane} package provides supplementary functions to the {gtsummary} specifically for trial reporting in the pharmaceutical industry.

## Installation

You can install the development version of crane from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("insightsengineering/crane")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(crane)
theme_gtsummary_roche()

tbl <- tbl_demographics(trial, by = trt, include = c(age, grade))
```

```{r tbl_print_simple, include = FALSE}
# Had to manually save images in temp file, not sure if better way.
gt::gtsave(as_gt(tbl), file = "man/figures/README-tbl_print_simple-1.png")
```

```{r out.width = "55%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-tbl_print_simple-1.png")
```

Each gtsummary table also contains the Analysis Results Dataset (ARD)

```{r cars}
# extract ARD from table
gather_ard(tbl)
```
