# crane

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The {crane} package provides supplementary functions to the {gtsummary} specifically for trial reporting in the pharmecuetical industry.

## Installation

You can install the development version of crane from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("insightsengineering/crane")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(crane)
theme_gtsummary_roche()

tbl <- tbl_demographics(trial, by = trt, include = c(age, grade))

tbl
```

Each gtsummary table also contains the Analysis Results Dataset (ARD)

```{r cars}
# extract ARD from table
gather_ard(tbl)
```
